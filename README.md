Your Soundboard
===============

Create your own soundboard!

Soundboard is an android app I'm developing for my kids. 
Its a simple app to create a soundboard from pictures and
sounds they record themselves.

It's not on play yet since it needs more styling,icons etc, but basic functionality is there.
